    <p>so yesterday when i was talking about how my friend betrayed me i didn't really explain what happened so today i'm here to do so. my friend who i've known for a fair ammount of time was a person who i trusted. i have a private instagram account where i post pictures of myself that i don't really want many people to see so i only accept a handful of people on that account. the pictures aren't nude or anything, they're all sfw but i still don't want the public to know about them. they are basically just me being dressed in my feminine clothing. this friend of mine was one of the people that got accepted and could see the pictures. turns out that friend of mine wasn't trustworthy at all, he showed the pictures to other people on multiple occasions behind my back. i don't know who to trust anymore. the person that i thought i could trust, the person that i thought would never betray me like this, actually did it. i'm losing faith in humanity.</p>
