        10/03/23: i have nothing to live for. my friends don't talk to me anymore, i am the failed
        child of my family, and i can't make new friends because of my extreme social anxiety. i no longer enjoy
        anything, nothing really
        excites me. most of my best friends are distancing themselves from me and i can't bring them back no matter how
        hard i try. maybe i am trying too hard, maybe it's the way i act that's making them not want to talk to me
        anymore. my best friend hasn't talked to me in over 3 months. my primary friend group is falling apart,
        partially because of me. i feel so alone in this world even though i am not. i was never alone, though no one
        ever understood me, and that hurts. that's what's making me feel so alone. i feel like shit. i wanted to achieve
        so much in life yet i have achieved nothing and i never will. i
        never really felt this way until this summer, when i realised i'm wasting my life doing nothing all year. i
        could be doing so much more than what i'm currently doing. no one cares about any of this, i don't even know why
        i'm writing this if no one is ever going to see this. i wanted to be special in one way or another, i would do
        anything to make people remember me. i wanted my story to be known until i realised that there was no story to
        be told, my life was always boring and if i were to write an autobiography, it would be the shortest and most boring
        shit ever written. no one will remember me when i eventually vanish from this world. i was never seen as anyone
        significant to anyone in this world. currently there is no one who sees me as anything more than maybe a friend,
        and this is what makes me feel so alone, it feels like i could literally disappear forever and not a single
        person would wonder where i went. i could do it right now. all it takes is for me to go downstairs and eat a
        bunch of pills and then just wait until it eventually kills me. and the thing is, at this specific time, this
        method is super effective, because i'm the only one awake at this hour and if i don't make much noise, not a
        single soul would notice.
