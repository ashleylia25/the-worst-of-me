        my sleep schedule is messed up. i got four hours of sleep. at school i could not focus for a single minute. my
        school-life overall is an absolute catastrophe. i just wish i could be like the other kids that have social skills and are
        able to make friends easily. i might keep on trying to overcome my social anxiety and approach one of the guys
        in my class and try to become friends with them. right now the only time anyone talks to me is when they need
        something. though i can't blame them for not wanting to talk to me. who even does wanna talk to me nowadays?
        i've turned into a horrible person and i hate myself every single day. why can i not just be normal like
        everyone else? why am i so different inside yet similar outside from everyone else? why am i such a terrible
        person? i hate myself so much, and the hatred keeps growing every day. i don't know how longer i can take it
        for, but it's already really bad.
