        today felt worse but better than yesterday at the same time. at school i
        didn't talk to anyone. it really shows how socially awkward i am. i haven't made a single friend and i've been
        in this school for over a month now. however i have come to realize that my family doesn't hate me, they accept
        me for who i am. or at least my mother does. she always tries her hardest to keep me motivated, and i appreciate
        that. but she doesn't know what i feel like, and that is because i keep it hidden from her. no one knows what i
        feel like right now. i never told anyone, and probably never will.
