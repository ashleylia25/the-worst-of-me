        i skipped a few days because i genuinely felt better than before and i did not really feel the need to vent about anything. i visited my brother in Brno and i had a great
        time there. after that i got sick and was doing just fine until today. now i'm feeling like shit again. everything went wrong. i am an absolute failure that never fails to disappoint, i am now the least successful member of my family, which is funny considering that just about half a year ago, it was the exact opposite. where did i go wrong? i feel like i'm losing everything i have. i'm having suicidal thoughts again. might write down some ways to actually do it and then maybe decide which one i'll go for when the time comes.
