    <p>my online friend asked me about my mood today. i finally decided to stop keeping it all inside and just vented to him. his reply was "fucking emo". this is exactly why i never vent to anyone, my biggest worry turned out to be true. i'm just an annoying piece of shit that can't have emotions because i am "always the happy one in the group and just seeking attention and ruining the mood by doing this". i'm never venting to anyone again.</p>
