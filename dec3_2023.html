    <p>i can't stop thinking about it. the ammount of people that have seen the pictures is absurd. he showed the pictures at an elementary class reunion when someone was talking about me. i'm so embarassed and feel like shit. i don't know how i'm gonna handle school tommorow and all of the other days this week. i feel too demotivated to do anything. i just wanna take some time to relax but that's impossible now since school takes up so much time of my schedule and there is almost no time left. when will i feel better again?</p>
