    <p>i feel left out of everything, i do not fit in anywhere. i'm thinking of completely cutting contact with my irl friends so that they can never contact me again and focusing all of my time on my online presence. my real life just doesn't work at all. it is a complete disaster. my online presence is somewhat better, today we had a little reunion with a couple of my online friends and that made me feel a bit better.</p>
