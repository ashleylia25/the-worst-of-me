        <p>Overdosing on drugs might be the easiest way to end your life. I would recommend anti-cough medicines that contains dextromethorphan. All you need to do is to take a dose that exceeds the recommended ammount multiple times and hope for the worst. What i mean is that you need to go way over the limit and take a large ammount to the point where your body cannot handle the ammount and it shuts down, you will probably experience seizures, hallucinations and breathing complications, and then (if not treated) you pass away. I would also recommend for it to have the effect we are looking for that you do this at night when your family is asleep so that nobody is there to stop you from doing this.</p>
