    <p>the hatred towards myself is growing stronger each day. i keep having suicidal thoughts, they just won't leave my
        head but instead keep me up at night and make me think about how big of a failure i am as a person. nothing
        helps. it keeps getting worse and it won't stop anytime soon. it's all going to become too much for me soon. i
        don't know how much time i have left, but it's probably not a lot.</p>
