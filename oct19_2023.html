    <p>what the hell have i become... i just scolded my own mother, the person that i care about the most in the world
        and i just did that to her. i realised that it was wrong of me to do this moments after she left my room and i
        started crying. i never wanted any of this. what a terrible person i am that does this kind of stuff to his own
        mother. she is the only person left that still cares about me and i don't really have anyone else at this point.
        i have become much more agressive than what i would normally come off as. maybe this is why my best friend left
        me and replaced me for someone who i don't talk to anymore. i'm just not good enough for anyone, not even
        myself. i am a dissapointment to my family, to my nation, to the world, and most of all, to myself.</p>
