    <p>it hurts to see my friends having much more fun without me than before when i was around. but if that's what
        makes them happy, then i guess it's for the better. i'm such a fucking idiot. why am i still alive? what purpose
        do i serve in this world? i have literally nothing to live for, yet i'm still sitting here writing my stupid
        notes. i hate myself so much, i just wish to not be here anymore.</p>
