        i can't sleep at night. horrible thoughts are running through my head nonstop and it keeps me up all night long.
        my close friends are ignoring me and it makes me feel like i'm losing everything. i replaced them all with
        people i don't even know in person. what a <i>great</i> friend i am. as much as i like these friends that i met
        online, it just doesn't feel right for them to be closer to me then my actual (former) real life friends. i'm
        glad it's weekend so i don't have to wake up early with two hours of sleep caused by my racing mind that keeps
        me awake. i hope i'll somehow fix this before monday. i went to Zlin with my mom and my brother and i have a
        pretty nice time there. i genuinely felt relaxed and i also feel like it helped me at least a tiny bit. i love
        my mom, she knows what's right and she tries her hardest to do the right thing in every situation. she is the
        best.
