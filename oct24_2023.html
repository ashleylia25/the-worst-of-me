    <p>not only do i now feel horrible because of how annoying, stupid, ugly and unfunny i am, i now hate myself because
        of my sexuality too. i think i might be bisexual. i like boys but at the same there is no way i could wrap my
        head around being gay. plus, i would literally be ending my bloodline by doing that. i mean to be fair, there
        was no way my bloodline was ever going to continue with how ugly i am. no girl would ever speak to me outside of
        school. but back to what i was saying. i like girls, but i also like boys. especially boys who appear more
        feminine. i think they're really cute. you can't even imagine how badly i dream of dating one. sadly that will
        never happen because of the reasons i stated before, i'm not going to repeat it again. i'm just so tired.</p>
