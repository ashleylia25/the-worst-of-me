        i don't even know who to consider my friend anymore. i'm starting to get annoyed by my closest friends so
        easily. and the weirdest part about it is that i wouldn't get annoyed by a simple joke a just a couple months
        ago, but now it suddenly is so annoying. i act like i don't care and that it doesn't matter what they say and
        just laugh along with them, but inside i don't feel that way. it upsets me so bad. at that point i wanna leave
        them behind and not talk to them anymore, but i never actually end the friendship. the joke was about me being
        lonely (as in not having a partner) which never really upset me because i always felt like i am better off
        alone, but this time it hit different for some reason. i never really get mad at people but i got really mad
        this one time, but i didn't say a single word in response, i just fake laughed and we moved on. all the horrible
        thoughts that i had the day before entered my head again. it was bad.
