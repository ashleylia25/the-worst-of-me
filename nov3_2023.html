    <p>i feel so embarassed. my physics teacher really hates me and i can do nothing about it, she won't change her opinion on me as much as i try to improve. i fucking hate myself so much, why am i such a worthless piece of shit that will never accomplish anything in life? everything i used to enjoy is just eh. i don't know what to do, i feel pressured to do anything at this point. nothing feels right. right now i'm thinking of planning an attempt at suicide.</p>
