    <p>forcing myself to go to school sick is a bad idea but i have to fix my grades because i don't wanna fail. i don't
        feel like doing anything at all. i just wanna lay in bed 24/7 and not care about all this bullshit. i thought of
        another way i could end my life but i'll get to that later. i might all of them down in a different document and
        link it to the main one. we'll see how it goes. i might do it on friday cause tommorow i'm most likely going to
        be lazy.</p>
