    <p>i thought it was going to be over. wow the ammount of stupidity that comes out of my mind is incredible. it is not even close to being over and it's probably going to get even worse and when it does i don't know if i'll be able to overcome it. we'll just see i guess. today was another one of those days where i felt like shit. nothing really makes me feel good at this point. one of my online friends which i do not really talk to as much anymore made my mood a bit better today and i'm thankful for that but i still have zero motivation for anything, all of the videogames i play are just meh. why does it have to be this way? i feel terrible. i just want a hug. one single hug. i'm sure that would make me feel better.</p>
