    <p>i just found out that the people i consider my best friends have a separate group chat without me where they play
        together on a daily basis. and the part that makes me feel the worst about it is that one of the members is a
        former friend of mine that i no longer talk to because he was being an asshole to newcomers in a videogame we
        used to play. every single one of the other members of the group chat agreed that it was a shitty thing to do on
        his side and we all didn't want to talk to him. the fact that my <b><i>best</i></b> friends that i used to talk
        to all the time and
        had my best moments with did this to me feels unreal, i thought they were the only people that liked me
        nowadays, but as it turns out, not even they do. i do feel betrayed but at the same time, i did this to myself,
        and i deserve it. and about my other friend groups, we don't really talk anymore. i introduced them to each
        other and they started talking to each other more than to me, which i think is totally fine but the fact that i
        could just dissapear and no one would care even in the slightest is what's making me feel so useless in this
        world, they wouldn't even notice my dissapearance. they probably already forgot about me. i'm no one to them.
