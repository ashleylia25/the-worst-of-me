    <p>today is not like the other days of the year. today is my 16th birthday, and it was a great for the most part. until the evening when a sudden wave of sadness hit me right in the head, i did get birthday wishes from my online friends, but i just feel like they did that to make it look like they still care about me. most of them don't talk to me outside of events like this one. i feel so lonely and left out. i give it about a week before they forget about me again.</p>
