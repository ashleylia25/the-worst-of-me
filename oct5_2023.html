        it just keeps getting worse. i came to school late today and i made a
        total fool out of myself. i heard them chuckle. it was the most embarrassing moment i've had in high school yet.
        now i'm 100% sure that they don't wanna talk to me and that they all think i'm an idiot. to be honest though, i
        can't blame them. i am an idiot. and it truly does feel horrible to be one when you yourself are aware of it. i
        forced myself to smile along with them to make myself look at least a bit better but it didn't help. i haven't
        truly smiled in weeks without forcing it in order to look happy. tommorow is finally friday and i will no longer
        have to interact with anyone for the rest of the week. i can finally rest. all it takes is just one more day.
