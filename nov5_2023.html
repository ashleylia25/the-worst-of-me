    <p>today i had a dream about me hugging my friend tightly and i felt so happy. it would be the first hug i've had in
        such a long time. but of course i had to wake up just to find out that it was all a dream and the illusion of
        happiness was yet again replaced by loneliness and self-despair. i just wish to never wake up again.</p>
