    <p>here we are again. after an entire month of feeling okay it started going downhill. anxiety attacks and constant moodswings are striking me almost every day for the past week but i thought it was gonna go away. it didn't. and what happened today just completely knocked me to the ground. there is no way i will be able to recover from this. my mother was going through my thing and found my skirt and thigh highs. i don't think i ever felt more embarassed than now in my life. later today she yelled at me. i don't know what to think. i do not feel safe at home anymore.</p>
