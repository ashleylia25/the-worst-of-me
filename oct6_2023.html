        i feel horrible. the realization that i replaced my best friend with someone who lives 300 miles away hurts me.
        and now my neither of them really talk to me anymore. the one that i originally considered my best friend hasn't
        talked to me in 3 months, and my <i>new</i> best friend barely talks to me. i think i might just give up on
        everything, let them enjoy their life, and not bother them ever again. what kind of a friend does that anyway? i
        don't wanna be known as an annoying idiot that always bothers his friends with stupid shit.
