    <p>it has been a while since i last made an update here. i'm doing much better now and i don't really feel like there is anything to vent about so i'll probably go inactive and no longer continue to update this file. venting (even though i am basically talking to myself) really helped me release stress and overall just made me feel so much better. i finally made a good choice. :3</p>
