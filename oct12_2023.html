            i don't know how long i have left before all of this becomes too much, but i think i'm already reaching my limit. today i had a sudden wave of suicidal thoughts and i even attempted it on my way back from school. i crossed the busiest street in the city on a red light, hoping to get ran over by someone. the attempt failed. all of the cars stopped and i only got yelled at for being an idiot. i might try it again or think of a new way to kill myself. right now i'm thinking about overdose, it might be the easiest way out of this world and it might not even be painful. this time i actually have faith in myself, i'm sure i will eventually discover a way that will make me get rid of all my struggles and let me finally die. this is the only thing i'm good for. other than that i still fucking hate myself more than ever before. the world would be a better place without a loser such as me.
