        i feel like shit. it only gets worse. most of my friends are ignoring me and i feel like the only ones that
        still talk to
        me are getting annoyed of me and will stop talking to me soon. i don't know if i should just leave them and let
        them live their own lives without
        an annoying piece of shit like myself or if i should continue talking to them and risking the achievement of
        their hatred towards me. one of the only friends left suffers from depression and is open about it but not
        everyone can relate to that and some people might get annoyed over hearing the same stuff so often. that is the
        reason why i'm so closeted about my feelings, i don't wanna annoy people. also among my friends i'm most known
        as a very happy and cheerful person all the time so i can't really show even a bit of my actual emotions. it
        sucks.
