    <p>i haven't eaten almost anything today. the only thing i ate was a sandwich that my mom made me for school. and i
        don't feel hungry at all, is that a problem? i kind of see it as a way to lose weight and a way to save time so
        i can focus more on other more important things. i might also stop playing videogames entirely, i just don't
        enjoy them anymore. they used to be the biggest source of entertainment for me but nowadays it doesn't really do
        it for me anymore. i bought a new game recently that brings back childhood memories of me and my brothers
        playing an older version of it together, but i can't seem to quite understand the newer mechanics, and i feel
        too lazy to get used to them. i wanna focus more on school and try to fix my grades at least a little bit
        because right now i'm failing two subjects. as much as i don't want to learn this stuff, i pretty much have to.
        otherwise i wouldn't care in </p>
