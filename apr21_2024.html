    <p>long time no see. after two months of doing alright i experienced one of the worst days of my life so far. i'm not sure if i mentioned this at some point but in early february i met a girl who i consider to be the love of my life. she is perfect in every aspect. i love her so much. we started dating. today she gave me a big reality check and i honestly don't think she loves me. i don't know if she ever loved me at all. i'm genuinely not sure what to think, what to believe, what to do or what to say. i felt like ending it all today.</p>
