    <p>when 2024 ended, i believed it to be the absolute lowest point of my life. i really hoped there wouldn't be a time worse than 2024, i tried to kill myself in september after the content from my private instagram account got leaked and recieved attention from my current classmates. i have never felt more embarassed. i fled from school the next day and didn't go to school at all for the entire rest of the week. i cut myself a lot but thankfully it was hoodie season so noone really saw it. i couldn't stop thinking about suicide since then. it's always in the back of my head, i think about it every single day, even when i appear happy and positive, the thought of it is still there. and after the year ended i was relieved. i thought the worst era of my life was finally beyond me, but i could not have been further away from the truth. january was already a disaster after my boyfriend started to ghost me and eventually broke up with me. i was devastated. he was one of the only people i could rely on. i had him and my mother. now i only have my mother, though i spoke about my struggles a little bit with a good friend of mine who unfortunately i probably will never meet because they live in new york and i'm in the biggest shithole in the middle of nowhere. anyways that's not what i was trying to talk about. the ammount of times i've self-harmed this year has probably exceeded the overall ammount of self-harm throughout my entire life up until the start of 2025. i tried to overdose on sedatives at the very end of january though i haven't succeeded. the thought of suicide has been on my mind nonstop. i can't go 20 minutes without thinking about taking my life. i started using self-harm as a way to distract myself from overthinking, it works quite well, though the effect is only temporary. and now i'm here, my head is fucked up, my body is fucked up, i purposefully treat myself like shit in hopes of dying out of natural causes so that my family won't be mad at me for killing myself. though throughout the years i noticed how my thoughts and mental health overall has been getting worse so who knows i might become really impatient one day and just end it there.</p>
