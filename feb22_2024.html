    <p>why does this keep happening? it always looks like it's starting to get better. it does not get better, the feeling is only temporary and i fall into the state i was in before so rapidly and easily that i do not have any more motivation to keep on trying to improve. i will always be a horrible person. i wanna run away from home and let others live without the shit i cause all the time. i've done more harm than good in this world.</p>
