    <p>and we're right back where we started. i'm slowly becoming what i feared the most, being forgotten by everyone.
        everyone is slowly but surely replacing me with other people. i am no one's best friend, all of my former best
        friends left me for someone else, there is only one real friend left that i still trust. most likely my last
        best friend ever. if even he switches up on me like the others did, i'm never going to trust anyone again. i've
        given trust to so many people that i felt like were trustworthy enough for it, but because of that, i lost
        almost everything. i have failed as a person. i fucking hate myself so much. i just wish i would fall asleep and
        never wake up again.</p>
