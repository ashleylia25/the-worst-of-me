    <p>i thought it was over, i thought i was going to live a happy and peaceful life from that point on. i was so
        wrong. ever since the last update, i made many new friends that i really liked to hang out with. but there was
        one that i knew way before these other guys. a friend who i've known for a decently long time, a friend that i
        trusted because i thought he was trustworthy. turns out he wasn't, he revealed a secret of mine that i shared
        with him multiple months ago, one that i'm very not comfortable with other people knowing of. how could i be so
        stupid to trust a guy like him. i fucking hate being who i am.</p>
