    <p>today i read online that we need 4 hugs per day to survive. i can tell you right now, that is a big pile of bullshit. i haven't had a hug in years and i'm still alive. other than that i feel a bit better now. i played in an osu! tournament today and the team was really friendly so that made my mood better. i didn't really perform well, but the team was supportive and they weren't being assholes about it. i felt comfortable playing in that team.</p>
